- grpc library is simple wrapper, do we need so simple tests?
  - as for me no
  - useful if grpc server is not ready, then a wrapper should have more validations, "catches" and useful errors

- pg:
  - no schema has been selected to create in
  - error: date/time field value out of range: "1570147200"
